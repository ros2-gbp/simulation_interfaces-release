# World is a virtual environment in which the simulation happens.
# Worlds are also known as scenes or levels in some simulators.
# Depending on the world format, loading of a world might be associated with changes
# in certain parameters, including physics settings such as gravity.
# World resources may be defined in standard or simulation-specific formats,
# and, depending on the simulator, loaded from local or remote repositories.
